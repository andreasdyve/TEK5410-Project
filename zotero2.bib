Page 8: Due to the increase in e-mobility and electric heat pumps, electricity demand in 2050 will only be insignificantly lower than 2005 levels.



UBA assumes that today’s best available technologies for energy-using appliances have diffused into the market and most energy efficiency potentials have been fully exploited by 2050. 



Total electricity consumption in our simulation is therefore 506 TWh, around 10\% lower than 2005 levels (564 TWh).

	abstract = {Global decarbonisation scenarios include Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as a key technology to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the power and industrial sectors. However, few large scale CCS plants are operating worldwide. This mismatch between expectations and reality is caused by a series of barriers which are preventing this technology from being adopted more widely. The goal of this paper is to identify and review the barriers to CCS development, with a focus on recent cost estimates, and to assess the potential of CCS to enable access to fossil fuels without causing dangerous levels of climate change. The result of the review shows that no CCS barriers are exclusively technical, with CCS cost being the most significant hurdle in the short to medium term. In the long term, CCS is found to be very cost effective when compared with other mitigation options. Cost estimates exhibit a high range, which depends on process type, separation technology, CO2 transport technique and storage site. CCS potential has been quantified by comparing the amount of fossil fuels that could be used globally with and without CCS. In modelled energy system transition pathways that limit global warming to less than 2 °C, scenarios without CCS result in 26\% of fossil fuel reserves being consumed by 2050, against 37\% being consumed when CCS is available. However, by 2100, the scenarios without CCS have only consumed slightly more fossil fuel reserves (33\%), whereas scenarios with CCS available end up consuming 65\% of reserves. It was also shown that the residual emissions from CCS facilities is the key factor limiting long term uptake, rather than cost. Overall, the results show that worldwide CCS adoption will be critical if fossil fuel reserves are to continue to be substantively accessed whilst still meeting climate targets.},

	abstract = {Many countries and territories have installed significant solar power capacity into their electrical grids to supplement or provide an alternative to conventional energy sources. 
Solar power plants use one of two technologies:

Photovoltaic (PV) systems use solar panels, either on rooftops or in ground-mounted solar farms, converting sunlight directly into electric power.
Concentrated solar power (CSP, also known as "concentrated solar thermal") plants use solar thermal energy to make steam, that is thereafter converted into electricity by a turbine.Worldwide growth of photovoltaics is extremely dynamic and varies strongly by country. By the end of 2019, a cumulative amount of 629 GW of solar power was installed throughout the world. By early 2020, the leading country for solar power was China with 208 GW, accounting for one-third of global installed solar capacity. As of 2020, there are at least 37 countries around the world with a cumulative PV capacity of more than one gigawatt.
The top installers of 2016 through 2019 were China, the United States, and India. 
The available solar PV capacity in Honduras is now sufficient to supply 12.5\% of the nation's electrical energy while Australia is approaching 11\%. Italy, Germany and Greece can produce between 7\% and 8\% of their respective annual domestic electricity consumption. Germany, situated in a region with only 1000 kWh per kWp solar potential, has produced up to 40 GW of power during peak hours on 27 April 2021, more than 60\% of the necessary 65 GW.
After an almost two decade long hiatus, deployment of CSP resumed in 2007. 
However, the design for several new projects is being changed to cheaper photovoltaics. 
Most operational CSP stations are located in Spain and the United States, while large solar farms using photovoltaics are being constructed in an expanding list of geographic regions.},

	abstract = {The worldwide total cumulative installed electricity generation capacity from wind power has increased rapidly since the start of the third millennium, and as of the end of 2020, it amounts to 733 GW. Since 2010, more than half of all new wind power was added outside the traditional markets of Europe and North America, mainly driven by the continuing boom in China and India. At the end of 2015, China had 145 GW of wind power installed. In 2015, China installed close to half the world's added wind power capacity.Wind power is used on a commercial basis in more than half of all the countries of the world. By 2018, several countries have achieved high levels of wind power penetration, such as 41\% of stationary electricity production in Denmark, 28\% in Ireland, 24\% in Portugal, 21\% in Germany and 19\% in Spain.
In November 2018, wind power generation in Scotland was higher than the country's electricity consumption during the month. Wind power's share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2018 was 4.8\%, up from 3.1\% four years earlier. In Europe, its share of power generation capacity was 18.8\% in 2018. In 2018, upcoming wind power markets rose from 8\% to 10\% across the Middle East, Latin America, South East Asia, and Africa.},
